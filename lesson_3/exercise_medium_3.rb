# Question 1
# Every named entity in Ruby has an object_id. This is a unique identifier for that object.

# It is often the case that two different things "look the same", but they can be different objects. The "under the hood" object referred to by a particular named-variable can change depending on what is done to that named-variable.

# In other words, in Ruby everything is an object...but it is not always THE SAME object.

# Predict how the values and object ids will change throughout the flow of the code below:
# def fun_with_ids
#   a_outer = 42
#   b_outer = "forty two"
#   c_outer = [42]
#   d_outer = c_outer[0]

#   a_outer_id = a_outer.object_id
#   b_outer_id = b_outer.object_id
#   c_outer_id = c_outer.object_id
#   d_outer_id = d_outer.object_id

#   # Notice that Ruby re-used the "42 object with id 85" when the value was the same.

#   puts "a_outer is #{a_outer} with an id of: #{a_outer_id} before the block."
#   puts "b_outer is #{b_outer} with an id of: #{b_outer_id} before the block."
#   puts "c_outer is #{c_outer} with an id of: #{c_outer_id} before the block."

#     d_outer_inner_id = d_outer.object_id

  # Wow, look at that. Even though we changed the values of our "outer" variables inside the method call, we still have the same values and the same object id's down here AFTER the method call as we had before it!
  #
  # This is because our method call accepts VALUES as parameters. The names we give to those values in the definition of our method are SEPARATE from any other use of those same names.
  #
  # We used the same names there for convenience (and admittedly to build some suspense and allow us to clarify this point). We could just as easily have called the first parameter of our method definition a_Fred instead of a_outer.
  #
  # The method gets the VALUES of the parameters we pass, but the parameter variables inside the method have no other relationship to those outside of the method. The names were coincidental, and confusing in a useful way.

#
# Question 3
# Let's call a method, and pass both a string and an array as parameters and see how even though they are treated in the same way by Ruby, the results can be different.
# Study the following code and state what will be displayed...and why:
def tricky_method(a_string_param, an_array_param)
  a_string_param += "rutabaga"
  an_array_param << "rutabaga"
end

my_string = "pumpkins"
my_array = ["pumpkins"]
tricky_method(my_string, my_array)

puts "My string looks like this now: #{my_string}"
puts "My array looks like this now: #{my_array}"

# Why the output is like this? It seems clear from the above that Ruby treats string and array parameters differently...but not so fast. Actually the parameters are treated in exactly the same way...but the results are different.

# In both cases, Ruby passes the parameter "by value", but unlike some other languages, the value that gets passed is a reference to some object. The string parameter is passed to the method as a reference to an object of type String. Similarly, the array is passed to the method as a reference to an object of type Array.

# The important distinction is that while a reference is passed, the method makes up a new variable for both the string and the array, and puts these references in these new variables...these are variables that only live within the scope of the method.

# So if both parameters live inside the method as a new variable that stores a reference to the passed object...why don't the string and the array behave the same way in our output?

# The difference lies in what Ruby does when the program executes either a String#+= operation or an Array#<< operation.

# The string operation is re-assignment and CREATES A NEW STRING OBJECT. The reference to this new object is placed in the internal variable of the method, and the method considers this new string object to be the one true string. It has forgotten about the one that was passed in now. That old stale parameter string is still remembered by the caller of the method...but the method itself has forgotten all about it.

# With the array, one array object can have any number of elements. When we attach an additional element to an array using the << operator, Ruby simply keeps using the same object that was passed in, and appends the new element to it.

# So, because the method's array variable still points to the original object, the caller's array variable and the method's array variable are still pointing at the same object, and we see the results of what happened to the array "outside" of the method.

#
# Question 4
# To drive that last one home...let's turn the tables and have the string show a modified output, while the array thwarts the method's efforts to modify the caller's version of it.

def tricky_method_two(a_string_param, an_array_param)
  a_string_param.gsub!('pumpkins', 'rutabaga')
  an_array_param = ['pumpkins', 'rutabaga']
end

my_string = "pumpkins"
my_array = ["pumpkins"]
tricky_method_two(my_string, my_array)

puts "My string looks like this now: #{my_string}"
puts "My array looks like this now: #{my_array}"
# As you can see, we have achieved the opposite effect from our last example.

# We are still passing in the same two string and array parameters, but the results are the opposite, because our method does the "same thing" to each, but in a different way than before. That is, in both cases, the method attempts to change the string from pumpkins to rutabaga and add a rutabaga to the array.

# Despite the similarity of results INSIDE the method, the results on the outside of the method are the opposite.

# As before, the explanation is all about what Ruby does with its internal variables when we change the object it points to. Does it create a new one? Or is it able to just modify the existing object?

# With the Array#= assignment, our literal ['pumpkins', 'rutabaga'] array IS a new object, and we are setting the internal array variable equal to that new array literal object.

#
# Question 5
# How could the unnecessary duplication in this method be removed?
def color_valid(color)
  if color == "blue" || color == "green"
    true
  else
    false
  end
end

# Ruby will automatically evaluate statements, so this method
# can be significantly simplified by changing it to just:

def color_valid_simple(color)
  color == "blue" || color == "green"
end

p color_valid("yellow")
p color_valid_simple("yellow")
